# Mountaineering news

A simple script that fetches news from [explorer web's mountaineering page](https://explorersweb.com/mountaineering) since I like to read mountaineering news.

***NOTE:*** This script does use the BSD and GNU variant of head and possibly other commands...which I probably need to modify at some point...
