# Mountaineering news

I like doing stuff on my terminal which includes reading news.

This is a simple (shoddy) script that fetches news from [explorer web's mountaineering page](https://explorersweb.com/category/mountaineering/) since I like to read mountaineering news.

***NOTE:*** This script does use the BSD and GNU variant of head and possibly other commands...which I probably need to modify at some point...
