# Exploratory news on the terminal

I like doing stuff on the terminal which includes reading news.

This is a simple (shoddy) script that fetches news from [explorer web](https://explorersweb.com/category/) since I like to read news re. a bunch of topics involving outdoorsy,alpinistic and mountaineery stuff.

You can choose from the categories listed, currently there's support for only 5 categories.

***NOTE:*** This script does use the BSD and GNU variant of head and possibly other commands...which I probably need to modify at some point...

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- You can alias this script if you want, add it to your relevant rc file.
- run `./news.sh -h` to see all the categories you can read news from.

## Features I wanna add

- Ensure code is clean...lol
- Remove options and just populate all the potential options as tab completable options
- Extend this to other websites as well
